# Design Concept: Kolo Pohody

## 1. Visual Style

**Minimalist and Clean:** The design will prioritize simplicity and clarity, reducing visual clutter to enhance focus on the user's well-being journey. Clean lines, ample whitespace, and intuitive layouts will be key.

**Organic and Natural:** Inspired by the concept of a "wellness wheel" and "flower of life," the visual style will incorporate organic shapes and natural textures where appropriate, avoiding harsh angles or artificial elements.

**Gentle Animations:** Subtle and smooth animations will be used to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience without being distracting. Examples include:
*   **Transitions:** Gentle fades or slides between screens.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Subtle scaling or color changes on button presses.
*   **Wellness Wheel:** Smooth, fluid animations when users interact with or update their wheel.

## 2. Color Palette

The color palette will be inspired by nature, promoting a sense of calm, balance, and growth. It will primarily consist of:

*   **Earthy Tones:** Soft greens, warm browns, and muted beiges to ground the design.
*   **Calming Blues:** Serene blues for a sense of tranquility and clarity.
*   **Subtle Accents:** Occasional pops of muted, natural colors (e.g., a soft terracotta or a deep plum) to highlight key elements or provide visual interest without overwhelming the user.

**Example Palette (Hex Codes - subject to refinement):**
*   #E0E0D8 (Light Beige/Off-White - Background)
*   #A8B4A0 (Soft Green - Primary)
*   #6B7F6B (Deeper Green - Secondary)
*   #8C7B6F (Warm Brown - Accent)
*   #5A6A70 (Muted Blue-Gray - Text/Icons)
*   #C8A89A (Soft Terracotta - Accent)

## 3. Typography

Typography will be chosen for readability and a friendly, approachable feel.

*   **Headings:** A clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Lato, Open Sans) for clear hierarchy.
*   **Body Text:** A highly readable sans-serif font with good legibility at smaller sizes (e.g., Roboto, Noto Sans).

## 4. User Experience (UX) Principles

*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Simple and clear navigation paths, allowing users to easily move between sections (wellness wheel, reflections, progress, settings).
*   **Personalization:** The ability for users to customize categories within their wellness wheel and set personal reminders.
*   **Positive Reinforcement:** Design elements and language will focus on encouragement and growth, rather than judgment.
*   **Privacy and Security:** Clear communication about data privacy and the option to make entries private.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensuring the app is usable for individuals with diverse needs, including sufficient color contrast and scalable text.

## 5. Mobile Responsiveness

The application will be designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless and optimized experience across various screen sizes and devices. This includes:

*   **Fluid Layouts:** Content will adapt dynamically to different screen dimensions.
*   **Touch-Friendly Elements:** Buttons and interactive areas will be appropriately sized for touch input.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Fast loading times and smooth interactions on mobile networks.

## 6. Key Features UX/UI Considerations

*   **Login:** Prominent and clear buttons for Google/Apple/Microsoft authentication.
*   **Wellness Wheel:** An interactive, visually appealing wheel where users can easily adjust their scores for each life area. Clear visual representation of progress over time.
*   **Reminders:** Gentle, non-intrusive notifications with customizable frequency and content.
*   **Micro-reflections/Journaling:** A simple, clean interface for text input, with options for formatting and tagging entries. Easy access to the "trash"/private feature.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Visual graphs or charts that clearly show trends and growth in different areas over time.
*   **Export to PDF:** A straightforward process for selecting entries and generating a printable PDF.
*   **AI Inspiration Generator:** A dedicated section with a clear call to action for generating quotes, playlists, or other inspirational content. The output should be presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner consistent with the app's design.
